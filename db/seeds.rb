Recently rescued from a terrible life in a puppy mill, Rue is a timid but affectionate little gal looking for a quiet home where she can rest and recharge from her ordeal. Her freckled coat and adorable underbite are sooo endearing, and we are looking forward to finding her a great home to appreciate her personality, not just her puppy-producing capabilities. Based on vet estimates, we believe she is around 5 years old. Rue is still learning about walking on a leash, housebreaking, and everything else involved in being a dog. Because of her timid personality, we are recommending she go to an adult-only home.

Her ideal forever family includes someone who can both play and cuddle. Pookie is sweet, friendly, and gentle, but she is still a puppy. She is learning basic obedience commands and has already learned how to walk on a leash. She is also being housebroken as you are reading this.
